    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",

      "Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\n",
      "four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\n",

      "at least completely engaging.\n",
      "[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\n",

      "startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\n",
      "defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\n",
      "intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\n",
      "meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\n",

      "in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\n",
      "The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\n",
      "is an answer to that question.\n",

      "computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\n",
      "translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\n",
      "and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\n",
      "in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\n",
      "gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\n",
      "It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\n",
      "why at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\n",
      "It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\n",
      "So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\n",
      "using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\n",
      "been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\n",
      "hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\n",
      "close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way ¬ó indeed,\n",
      "there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\n",
      "complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\n",
      "then weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\n",
      "axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\n",
      "And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\n",
      "discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\n",

      "do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\n",
      "why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\n",

      "at it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \n",
      "in itself in Arc. That may sound\n",
      "like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\n",
      "I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\n",
      "collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\n",

      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- 12 oz (340g) spaghetti or tonnarelli\n",
      "- 1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated\n",
      "- 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt (for boiling pasta)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "1. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until *just al dente*. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Toast the pepper:** In a large skillet or pan, toast the black pepper over medium heat for 1-2 minutes to release its aroma.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create the sauce:** Lower the heat and add about ¬Ω cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet with the pepper. Gradually stir in the Pecorino Romano cheese, a little at a time, until a creamy sauce forms. Keep stirring to prevent clumping.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Combine pasta and sauce:** Add the drained pasta to the skillet, tossing it with the sauce. If the mixture seems too dry, add a bit more pasta water until the sauce fully coats the pasta.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Serve:** Plate the pasta immediately and sprinkle with extra Pecorino Romano or black pepper, if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your Roman classic, Cacio e Pepe!\n"
